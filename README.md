# Hangman-game-
A classic Hangman game built in Python. Players try to guess a randomly chosen word by guessing letters one at a time. The game visually displays the progress of the stick figure as wrong guesses accumulate. The player wins if they correctly guess the word before the figure is fully drawn.
